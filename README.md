```

## Key Technical Deliverables

### 1. Optimized SQL Analytics Engine
- **15+ Production-Grade Queries** handling 100K+ records
- **Window Functions** for time-series claims analysis
- **CTEs** for complex provider performance calculations

**Performance Benchmark**  
```sql
/* Provider Efficiency Analysis */
WITH ProviderStats AS (
    SELECT 
        Provider,
        AVG(InscClaimAmtReimbursed) OVER(PARTITION BY Provider) AS AvgReimbursement,
        COUNT(ClaimID) OVER(PARTITION BY Provider) AS TotalClaims
    FROM in_patient_data
)
SELECT 
    Provider,
    ROUND(AvgReimbursement, 2) AS AvgReimbursement,
    TotalClaims,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AvgReimbursement DESC) AS EfficiencyRank
FROM ProviderStats
WHERE TotalClaims > 100;
```
